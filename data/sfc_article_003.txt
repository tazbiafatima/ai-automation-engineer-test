Golden State Warriors head coach Steve Kerr was honored Tuesday with the Rudy Tomjanovich Award, given annually by the Pro Basketball Writers Association to the NBA coach who best exemplifies combined cooperation with the media and fans with excellence on the court.

The award is named after Tomjanovich, a former NBA forward and head coach best known for guiding the Houston Rockets to consecutive championships in 1994 and 1995 — but also known for his professionalism during interactions with reporters. 

Kerr, 58, previously won the award in 2015 and 2018. This season, he beat finalists Chris Finch (Minnesota Timberwolves), Darvin Ham (Los Angeles Lakers), Michael Malone (Denver Nuggets) and Jamahl Mosley (Orlando Magic) for his third honor.

Formerly an NBA broadcaster for TNT, Kerr has long mused thoughtfully with the media — offering insights regularly about the Warriors, the league at large and topics beyond basketball. He routinely granted one-on-one interviews with local and national reporters alike.

At his annual end-of-the-season news conference last month at Chase Center, he opened by thanking reporters for their coverage.

“Not every coach actually enjoys these (news conferences). I enjoy these. I enjoy seeing you guys,” he said. “I never forget what our business is about, which is connecting our team to our fans. Telling our players’ stories. … So, I just want to tell you, I appreciate the difficulty of your job and you guys do a really good job of covering our team and telling our stories and connecting our fans and all of that is really important.”
